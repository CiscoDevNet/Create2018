## Objectives
The objective of this workshop is to:

* Acquire digital data about a real world process occuring in network infrastructure
* Interpret the data in the context of a migration event occuring in a timed window
* Create relevant progress metrics and display them in a visually appealing way
* Leverage the Cisco Spark API and application to share the progress with a team

## BYOD Requirements
### Bring a 20ft Ethernet cable and an Ethernet dongle if your laptop requires one
During the workshop you will be interacting with a pair of switches. Without an ability to attach to the switches... well, let's just say you won't get much value from the workshop!
