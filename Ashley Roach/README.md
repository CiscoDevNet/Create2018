Creating a REST API Microservice using swagger-node

## Description

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Swagger to design and
implement a REST API microservice.  We will cover a design-first approach
with the Swagger description language and the benefits of using a tool
like this, and package the REST API in a Docker container.  We will also
talk briefly about the OpenAPI spec.  Some familiarity with Node JS will
be beneficial to participants in this workshop.
