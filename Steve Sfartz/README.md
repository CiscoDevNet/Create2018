## Build a React App that Shows Live Activity at DevNet Create (WS25A)

Discover React development and Cisco Collaboration Endpoints (CE9.2.1+) programmability.

Throughout the workshop, you'll first learn to compute Meeting Room Analytics from real-time events sent by Meeting Room Device’s Camera.
We'll then go through the code of a React App that shows a map of DevNet Create 2018 location, and update it to display how many developers are attending each workshop. 

_Pre-requisites: you have 1 to 3 years of professional development experience and a laptop with a pre-configured Node.js v6+ development environment._

### BYOD Requirements

A laptop with a pre-configured Node.js v6+ development environment, Cisco Spark, postman and a git client. 
Here are some instructions to set up such an environment with Visual Studio Code. https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-express-cloud-collab-soft-dev/devnet-express-collab-setup-sd/collab-dne-event-setup-sd/step/1.

## Advanced Postman

Postman has become the de-facto standard to forge REST requests. In this session, we'll dig into the many benefits one can get by leveraging advanced Postman features: collections, scripting, batch running, testing, documenting.

_Pre-requisites: you know basics about REST API, and have eventually used Postman or a similar REST client._


### BYOD Requirements

A laptop with the latest [postman native app 6.0+](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) installed, a Postman account, and a Cisco Spark account.

## Create a ChatBot Game Backed with NLP

In this session, we'll code a ChatBot leveraging conversational features brought by Botkit, in order to create a game.

We'll use Cisco Spark as a messaging platform, store states at user level for preferences and at the room level for game scores. 

We'll then add NLP from Recast.ai (SAP's recent acquisition) to make our conversations more human friendly.

_Pre-requisites: you have 1 to 3 years of professional development experience._
