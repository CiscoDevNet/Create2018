# WS13A - Security Research and Response Workflow

Hey Everyone! Welcome to Security Research and Response Workflows! 

Wanted to take a moment to give you guys some context around what you will need to do this workshop with me.

### BYOD Requirements
> Windows or Mac personal computer

> Postman installed - https://www.getpostman.com/ 

> Python 2.7.x installed - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/ 

> Requests library for python - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ 

For those of you who prefer python 3.x You are welcome to use it there may be moderate difference in how the example scritps work though nothing too serious. 

If you prefer to follow along directly with the code provided please go with 2.7 as it will be plug and play.

Look forward to seeing all of you in Mountain View!
